### Design

- We will be using the *winston* middleware to capture logs and these logs will be stored in MongoDB.
- Based on the use cases the data will be logged into MongoDB / Kafka topics.
- The reporting GUI can be built on top of data from MongoDB and or MySQL.



### Observations.

1. User activity can be captured in the Kafka topic.
2. This capture is realtime and can be used for further analysis directly or dumped to archival.


### TODO.

- [x] List down common uses cases.
- [x] Create a logging lib for the required transport.
- [ ] Create a logging schema for each module based on the use case.
- [ ] Create schema for MongoDB collections based on modules.
- [ ] Update the module code to use the logging lib and log data to the MongoDB transport.
- [ ] Test the collection updates.
- [ ] Create Kafka topics for real-time data.
- [ ] Create the reporting service.
